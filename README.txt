Word guessing game

This game concept is well-known, however I think this is a exercise to practice code writing.

For those who are not familiar with the way to play this game here are the rules:
1)One person comes up with a random word of choice and inputs it in the computer.
2)Then the computer saves the information and hides so the other player cannot see the word.
3)Now that other person starts guessing the word letter by letter or simply writes the whole word if he/she
 is so sure of the right answer. But there is a catch - for each wrong answer whether it is a letter or the
 whole word, one less try is left(in the beginning player who guesses has 5 tries or "lives" as said in the
 actual game.
4)For each correct letter guessed computer shows each position it is at( other letters which are not guessed are replaced by uderscore)
5)Game ends when the player guesses all the letters or runs out of 5 given lives.
